# 28 React Native Interview

Welcome to 28's React Native interview. You will find a few subprojects in this
repository:

* Stub React Native app under `react-native/` (created with the `react-native` CLI)
* Simple Express+TS backend under `rest-server/`

First, take a look around at the backend server. Your task in this interview is
to build a simple React Native app which visualizes the data from this backend.
As there is limited time in this interview (~75 minutes for coding), please
prioritize your time effectively as you would on the job.

## Instructions

We are building a simple mobile app for conference attendees to see the schedule
of talks and surface appropriate information to help people decide which talks
to attend or not.

Milestones (we may not cover all or in order but a rough guide):

- [x] Build a simple scrollable view to show all events in the mobile app
- [x] Add additional fields to the `Talk` data model to provide time information for each talk
- [x] Allow users to "save" or "bookmark" events on the mobile app
